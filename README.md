# GIX 510-Lab6
# LLM and Chatbot Integration

This project explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT with chatbot systems. The focus is on understanding the architecture, training processes, and application of LLMs in generating human-like text for automated conversations.

## Get started
```
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

```

## Lessons Learned
- Understanding the intricate working of LLMs including their training on large text corpora and their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
- Challenges associated with training LLMs such as the need for vast data and computational resources.
- The importance of fine-tuning the model to specific tasks to enhance performance and relevance.

## Final Project Preparation
Backend
Method1
Azure function
-triggered by image upload

Method2
Deploy app as webapp
-Use the url as api

Frontend
Ui-streamlit

Save photo
Use the last part of the file name
Streamlit image - display

## Questions
- In the actual development of UI interfaces and interactions, is it necessary to use a platform such as streamlit? For example, if I want to design some UI components and user interactions that are not available in streamlit, how do I need to do it?

## TODO
1. Open the Colab notebook, try the different prompting techniques (Use OpenAI API or Gemini)
2. What problems did you face when developing the last LLM powered app? Can they be solved with new prompting techniques?
3. Improve or create a new app
4. Apply the prompting techniques to your app
5. Specify how the new prompting techniques addressed the problems.
